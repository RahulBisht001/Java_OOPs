### Inheritance ✅✅


   Inheritance in Java is a mechanism where a class can inherit the properties and behaviors from another class. 
   This allows for the creation of new classes that are built upon existing classes, promoting reusability and 
   reducing the amount of code that needs to be written.

   A subclass (also known as a derived class or child class) can inherit fields and methods from a superclass
   (also known as a base class or parent class). The subclass can also add new fields and methods, or override 
   methods of the superclass.
